# BagOfHolding

Bag of holding is an inventory management solution originally intended for use in DnD

Allows the user to easily track the value of their current inventory, as well as the cost total of items they've consumed in the past. This is very handy in campaigns where players have easy access to buying and selling their magic items between sessions.
